PTP-like algorithm debug
========================

tsync_*.py scripts can be used to visualise debug files, written when the PTP-like algorithm
is compiled with TSYNC_DEBUG defined. The files are located in the guest machine:
    s-cid*.txt - For each offset calculation: host and guest clocks and calculated offset.
    res-cid*.txt - For each tracing session: all calculated clock offsets.

tsync_hist.py plots a histogram, using data from a s-cid*.txt file:
	"python tsync_hist.py s-cid2_1.txt"
tsync_res.py plots a line, using data from res-cid*.txt file:
	"python tsync_res.py res-cid2.txt"
